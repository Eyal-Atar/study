# Phase 14-01: Mobile-First UX - Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Completed (with user feedback about mobile density)

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Bumped JS cache-bust version from `v=10` to `v=14` in `index.html`, `app.js`, `calendar.js`, and `interactions.js`.
- [x] Verified `v=10` references are removed and `v=14` is correctly applied.
- [x] Verified (via human sign-off) that the bottom tab bar, mobile app bar, and bottom-sheet modals are active on mobile viewports.
- [x] Verified that touch-drag interactions are enabled for mobile.

## User Feedback
- User confirmed the changes are visible but noted that the roadmap is "still big and needs lots of scrolling."
- User acknowledged "many bugs" but approved the plan as "working."

## Next Steps
- Research ways to increase calendar density or implement a more compact mobile roadmap view.
- Investigate and resolve bugs reported by the user in the mobile UX.
