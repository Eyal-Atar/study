# Plan: Phase 07-02 - Onboarding Wizard UI

Convert the onboarding welcome screen into a multi-step profiler wizard.

<task id="ui_structure">
  <files>
    <file>frontend/index.html</file>
  </files>
  <action>
    Modify `screen-onboarding` to include:
    - Step 1: Hobby Selection (Gym, Gaming, Reading, Other) with placeholder examples.
    - Step 2: Daily Window (Wake up, Sleep) and Study Load (Neto Hours).
    - Step 3: Peak Productivity (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
    - Step 4: Profile Success Animation/Feedback screen.
    - Progress dots and Next/Back buttons.

<task id="wizard_logic">
  <files>
    <file>frontend/js/auth.js</file>
  </files>
  <action>

    Click through the wizard (Next and Back) and verify that steps transition correctly and validation works.
